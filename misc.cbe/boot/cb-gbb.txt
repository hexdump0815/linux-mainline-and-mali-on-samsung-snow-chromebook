IMPORTANT: do all the below on your own risk, it might damage your chromebook - for me it worked perfectly fine the three times i did it

this will give you
- a niceer bootup screen (no longer the white chromeos one)
- a shorter delay until the boot starts (2sec and no more beep instead of 30sec and an annying beep)
- booting from usb will always be allowed (otherwise the chromebook might forget this when the batery gets empty)

- first remove the flash write protect screw (it is a sticker actually) inside of the notebook - see https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Chromebook+Series+3+Teardown/12225
- login into developer mode - see https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/samsung/samsung-chromebook
- on cmdline:
shell
sudo su
- go somewhere, where a "touch testfile" does not give an error, because the dir is read-only - the users homedir is an option
flashrom --wp-disable
flashrom --wp-status
- the meaning of the flags set below:
# GBB_FLAG_DEV_SCREEN_SHORT_DELAY     0x00000001
# GBB_FLAG_FORCE_DEV_SWITCH_ON        0x00000008
# GBB_FLAG_FORCE_DEV_BOOT_USB         0x00000010
/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x19

flashrom -r bios.bin

gbb_utility -s --bmpfv=nothing bios.bin
